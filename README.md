INSIGHTS:
  More than 22% of all advertisements appear on a single page, suggesting that a small number of corporations account for a significant portion of the volume of political commercials.
  Approximately 55% of messages are advocacy-based, with attack or issue-based marketing receiving far less attention.
  This implies that campaigns prioritise promotion over critique or discussion of policies.
  There is a significant right-skewedness in estimated_spend and impressions, with some advertisements spending a lot of money and many spending very little.
  Some expensive advertisements seem ineffective because they don't produce enough impressions.
  USD is used in more than 99.9% of advertisements, indicating a concentration on the US.
  Extremely low mention rates for categories including COVID, LGBTQ, immigration, and foreign policy suggest that they are either strategically avoided or given minimal emphasis in messaging.
